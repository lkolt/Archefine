925: This means that, in most cases, to trigger a context switch, you can add a &#39;format&#39; parameter to your request: Via URL parameter: /news/list/format/xml (recall, the default routing schema allows for arbitrary key/value pairs following the action) Via GET parameter: /news/list?format=xml ContextSwitch allows you to specify arbitrary contexts, including what suffix change will occur (if any), any response headers that should be sent, and arbitrary callbacks for initialization and post processing.

1377: Subclassing the Front Controller To subclass the Front Controller, at the very minimum you will need to override the getInstance() method: Overriding the getInstance() method ensures that subsequent calls to Zend_Controller_Front::getInstance() will return an instance of your new subclass instead of a Zend_Controller_Front instance -- this is particularly useful for some of the alternate routers and view helpers.
